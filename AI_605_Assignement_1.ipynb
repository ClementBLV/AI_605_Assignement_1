    ">**Answer** \\\n",
    "\n",
    ">There are several ways to avoid an exploding gradient. A  common way is the $\\mathcal{L}_2$ regulation approach, which is based on a \"weight decay\" of the cost function of the network. But there is also the **gradient Clipping** which has better results and is easier to implement. The gradient clipping is used during the backward propagation phase. The error derivative is changed or clipped to a threshold, and the clipped gradient updates weights.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">When the error is rescaled, it will also rescale the weight during their updates. In this way the risk of overflow or underflow of the network. They are two ways to \"clip the gradient\".The first one is clipping by value: here we have two boundary values,  if the gradient is not between them it is clipped and receives the threshold value.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The second method is clipping by norm, if the norm of the gradient exceeds a threshold value, then $$gradient= threshold.\\frac{gradient}{||gradient||} $$ Like the gradient, the maximum norm a gradient can achieve is the threshold. So it avoids exploding gradient.\n",

    "> At the end we have $\\forall t$ \n",

    "\n",
    "> **Problem 1.3** *(2 points)* Explain how vanishing gradient can be mitigated if we use LSTM. See the Lecture 05 and 06 slides for the definition of LSTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The vanishing gradient, means that the gradient becomes too small and doesn't change at each iterations. The LSTM method uses different \"gates\" which appear in the expression of the gradient. There is a gate called forget gates, the forget gate's vector of activation helps the model do decide whether or not the value should be forgotten. To avoid the vanishing gradient, we just have to choose the parameter of the gates such as in the next step we don't have $ \\nabla \\longrightarrow 0$ \n",
    "Mathematicaly we can see it with the expretion of the output of an LSTM cell: \n",
    "$$ c_t = f_t * c_{t-1} + i_t * \\widetilde{c_t}  (1)$$\n",

    ">But, $ i_t * \\widetilde{c_t}$ and $f_t$ are independant of $c_t, \\forall t $. So $\\forall i \\in [[ 1, t]]$ : \n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Here $f_t = \\sigma_g (W_fx_f + U_f +b_f)$ where $\\sigma_g$ is the sigmoide fonction. So, $\\forall i \\in [[2, t]], f_i \\in [0, 1]$. So for each iterations, the gradient will remain close to 1. So as the equation (2) shows, the gradient of the LSTM correspond to the product of the vectors $f_i$, and so cannot vanish. On the other hand, the gradient of the RNN is proportionnal to V so if V is to slow, after only a few iteration it vanishes exponentially.  "
